# File Extensions #

Some file extensions listed are used by multiple applications.

## SIMPL Windows (Symbol Intensive Master Programming Language) ##
<table>
<tr>
<td width="10%">Extension</td>
<td width="90%">File Description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.smw</td>
<td>SIMPL Windows application source normally edited by the SIMPL Windows editor. Normally text but may have binary portions that are encoded (password protected) modules that have been added to the program.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.smw.asv</td>
<td>Auto-saved version (?) Backup copy of .smw automatically created by timer based auto-save</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.umc</td>
<td>User macro. User created module (library) that can be included in SMW projects. Edited using SIMPL Windows editor. Normally text but encoded into binary format if password protected</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.cmc</td>
<td>Crestron Macro. Crestron supplied module (library). Normally text but encoded in binary format if password protected. At one time I believe SIMPL Windows would open these files, if they were not password protected, but the current versions detect a file "signature" and prevents the SIMPL Windows editor from opening them</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.usp</td>
<td>SIMPL+ module. Edited using the SIMPL+ editor. Normally text but encoded in binary format if password protected</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.ush</td>
<td>Header file for a .usp file. Automatically generated by compiler at compile time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.rsd</td>
<td>Remote system definition file. Used to setup intersystem communications between two programs running on the same or different processors</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.lpz</td>
<td>Series 3 proc program zip file. Contains compiler built application package with .bin application, DLLs and metadata required to setup hardware and execution environment. May optionally contain an archive of the program source code if archive option is active at compile-time. The .dip file contains IP ID data that can restored using Toolbox</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.lpz.hash</td>
<td>Contains date/time of application compile</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.spz</td>
<td>Series 2 Proc program zip file. Contains compiler built application package with .bin application and metadata required to setup and execute application.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.bin</td>
<td>Contains SMW compiled code which will be interpreted by LogicEngine.exe</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.sig</td>
<td>Signal file. Signal data file created by compiler and used by Toolbox's debugger</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>.smft</td>
<td>SIMPL or System device manifest (?). Created by compiler and lists devices, device IP IDs for Cresnet, Ethernet and RF</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SPlsWork (folder)</td>
<td>Editor and Compiler temp directory. I believe the editor may use this during program load but it's definitely used by the compiler. It's a good practice to delete this folder. If you sync source directories between computers do not include this folder! Do not archive the folder as it is automatically created at compile time. If SIMPL Windows is crashing during compile, delete the folder and then try to recompile.</td>
