# Crestron Best Practices #

### Device Firmware and Upgrading ###
There is probably a 50/50 split about upgrading firmware and as such, the best practice is unclear. Some Crestron employees will tell you very plainly, if you aren't experiencing problems, or you don't require new features, firmware should not be upgraded for the sake of upgrading. Others argue that upgraded firmware fixes problems and you should upgrade. At the same time, one must recognize that upgraded firmware may introduce new bugs. You have to find the right balance for your clients. Upgrading on release day is not a best practice unless you are working directly with Crestron on a particular bug.
